2 - 3pm: I was planning to do some literature review on algorithm and evaluation function for coding preparation; I found some valuable resources and designed some good evaluation functions.
6 - 7pm: I was planning to write functions for calculating how many connected fours are in the board; It felt much harder than I expected, and I was still working on.
7 - 8pm: Kept working on writing functions... Finished the part of open and half fours for possible columns.
8 - 9pm: I was planning to write some tests for testing my code; I wrote two tests and both of them passed.
9 - 10pm: I was planning to wrap up and create a Github repository; I created a Github repository: https://github.com/cjy-2001/CS311-Gomoku and shared with my teammate.
